      <h1>Built From Real Player Development.</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        The Vault Baseball Academy was created to give athletes a clear, honest path to velocity, power, and performance —
        without shortcuts. We believe in systems, intentional progressions, athlete ownership, and transparency.

        <h3>Why The Vault exists.</h3>
        <p>
          Too many athletes are stuck between random drills and one-size-fits-all programs. The Vault exists to bridge
          that gap with structured, adaptable development systems.

    <h2>Core Principles</h2>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Clarity</h3>
        <p>
          Athletes make their biggest jumps when the plan is clear. Every Vault program includes exact weekly layouts,
          so athletes understand what to do and why.

        <h3>Durability</h3>
        <p>
          Velocity without arm-care is a trap. Our progressions integrate mobility, recovery, and stress management
          so athletes can build and keep their gains.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Accountability</h3>
        <p>
          Tracking matters. Readiness matters. Intent matters. The Vault uses simple tools that make progress visible —
          daily and weekly.
