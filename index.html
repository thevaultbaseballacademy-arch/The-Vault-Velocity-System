      <div class="card">
        <h3>System over randomness.</h3>
        <p>
          No more guessing. Every program includes structured weekly calendars, drill explanations,
          intent guidelines, rest days, and progression models.

        <h3>Velocity with durability.</h3>
        <p>
          We chase speed the right way — with mobility, arm-care, and recovery integrated into every block,
          so you can actually stay on the field.
